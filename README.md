# Security Operation Center (SOC) Home Lab

## Objective

The goal of the SOC HomeLab project was to create a controlled setting for simulating and identifying cyber threats. Its main objective was to ingest and examine logs using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, thereby producing simulated telemetry to replicate real-world attack situations. This interactive experience was crafted to enhance comprehension of network security, attack methodologies, and defensive tactics.

### Skills Learned

- Developing a solid grasp of SIEM concepts and their real-world applications.
- Acquiring proficiency in the analysis and interpretation of network logs.
- Cultivating the ability to recognize and generate attack signatures and patterns.
- Gaining a better understanding of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Nurturing critical thinking and problem-solving skills within the cybersecurity domain.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Virtualization like VirtualBox A virtualization platform for hosting virtual machines (VMs) to simulate network environments.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
